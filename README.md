# Grammar-Based Fuzzing Architecture
**Objective:** Implementation of coverage-guided and grammar-based fuzzing techniques based on the research of the Zeller Group (CISPA).

## Modules
1. **Basic Fuzzer** (Implemented): A random string generation engine to test input robustness.
2. **Coverage Tracker** (Coming Soon): Logic to trace code execution paths.
3. **Grammar Definitions** (Coming Soon): Structure-aware generation.

## Usage
Run the basic fuzzer:
`python src/fuzzer.py`
